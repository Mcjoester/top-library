# Library Project

#### For this project I applied what I learned on Object Constructors and Prototypal Inheritance from the Odin Project. I have not applied form validation on the from part yet as that is something I will be coming back to. For now I was more focused on applying what I learend on the topics obove and getting it in working condition.
